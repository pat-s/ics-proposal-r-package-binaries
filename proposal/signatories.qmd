Josiah Perry has acknowledged the usefulness lately and even [donated for it](buymeacoffee.com/patrickschratz/c/12848930).

Sharing the project in the `rstats` subreddit [resulted in some very positive reactions](https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/comments/1iq7isu/package_binaries_for_arm64_and_alpine/).

As my social media accounts are not having the greatest reach and Twitter/X is basically dead, the reactions there were limited.

A [blog post](https://www.devxy.io/blog/cran-r-package-binaries-launch/) shared on my website has been shared in rweekly in December 2024.

Last, a variety of business clients of mine have shared their enthuisiams with me personally, hoping to see a positive development of the overall project idea.
