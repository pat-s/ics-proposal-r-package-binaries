# Project plan

## Start-up phase

The project is already up and running with respect to the core components and infrastructure.

## Technical delivery

An up-and-running global package binary download service which processes daily incoming changes of CRAN packages (additions / removals / updates).

For the core engine behind, continuous releases and improvements.

## Other aspects

The project would profit from more public promotion and user testing/use. 

Presentations at common R conferences are planned and are important for establishing the project within the community.
