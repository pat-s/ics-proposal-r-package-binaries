# Requirements

## General

- Support for continuous development of the code engine
- Cost coverage for the public running service building CRAN packages for various distributions and architectures

## People

Additional people which ensure an upkeep of the public package build service and the underlying servers.

The project can be run by a single person technically, more people would be helpful to improve the project code and robustify the service maintenance.

## Tools & Tech

- For the public CRAN build service, a cloud infrastructure (already existing) which provides native `x86_64` and `arm64` runners that are able to natively build the respective packages.
The servers need decent CPU power to minimize build times and being able to process all existing packages, in scenarios of major OS version updates, in a reasonable time.

- A (professionally) managed database storing the build metadata (already in place).

- S3 storage in the cloud (currently using Hetzner, 1TB/m = 5 EUR).

- UI frontend showing available packages (optional).
  Currently, a self-built Shiny App Dashboard is in use (<https://app.devxy.io/app/r-package-binaries-dashboard>)

## Funding

There are two main types of funding:

1. General maintenance and improvement of the "engine" and its related documentation
1. Coverage of cloud costs for the running service providing binaries for CRAN packages 

For (1), I do not know if there are hard-coded policies in place for human workforce costs per project/hour. It would surely be great to have financial support for this, but overall, (2) is more important in my opinion.

For (2), I'll outline a cloud cost overview which will be able to efficiently provide the technical resources to run the overall CRAN build service for the forseeable future:

| Name                                             | ~ Cost/month | ~ Costs / year | Notes                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `x86_64` Server (8 cores, 16 threads, 64 GB RAM) | 54 Euro              | 648 Euro     | Used to build `x86_64` binaries, bare-metal root server                                |
| x2 `arm64` Server (16 cores, 32 GB RAM)          | 52 Euro              | 624 Euro     | Used to build `arm64` binaries, shared Cloud Server, price for two units               |
| Database Servers (HA)                            | 12 Euro              | 144 Euro     | HA Database for build metadata                                                         |
| S3 storage costs                                 | 15 Euro              | 180 Euro     | Costs for 3 TB, current storage is at 2.14 TB                                          |
| CDN costs                                        | ?? Euro              | ?? Euro      | CDN bandwith/transfer costs. 10$/1 TB bandwith, + local storage zones around the world |

While the core setup (servers, S3, DB) should stay quite static at ~ 150 / month (1800 / year), the bandwith costs for fast downloads around the world is dynamic.
If the service is picked up by the community on a large scale, costs of multiple hundreds per month could occur, when with a cost-efficient CDN provider.

## Summary

The project would benefit from workforce costs for continous development of the core engine and coverage of the running cloud costs.
Increasing the bus-factor for people with access to the core components of the infrastructure would make the project more robust against failures or human absences.
