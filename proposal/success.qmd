# Success

## Definition of done

1. A running, public build service providing R package binaries for Linux to the community which has caused minimal interruptions for users across a timespan covering multiple OS updates.
1. A framework/engine for building binary packages, written in R, with extensive documentation around its usage and optional extensions (e.g. metadata database), allowing users to easily host and use their own package repository.

## Measuring success

- Download counts
- Tracking missing/corrupted packages in the public service
- Gathering user feedback on the overall process of creating custom user repositories

## Future work

Encouraging community contributions could play a key role in sustaining the project over the long term.
Ultimately, it would be fantastic to have an open, free, and professional-grade tool that not only supports the creation and maintenance of custom user repositories, but also delivers a high-performance binary package repository for CRAN packages out of the box.

## Key risks

The project faces several potential risks:

- Gaining broad acceptance within the community and building trust in the service and its build process
- Competition from established players in the space (e.g., Posit) offering proprietary alternatives
- Bus factor: ensuring that multiple individuals have access to all critical components of the infrastructure to prevent reliance on a single person
- Uncertainty around long-term funding to cover operational costsâ€”particularly bandwidth expenses, which could become significant if community adoption grows substantially
